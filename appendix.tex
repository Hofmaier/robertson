\subsection{Functor}
\label{sec:functor}

Functor is a type class for types, which can be mapped over. Another way to describe functors is that they represent some sort of computational context \cite{yorgey}. The general concept of a functor is more abstract and harder to grasp than the concepts of type classes described in section \ref{sec:typeclass}.
The most accurate way to describe the type class \verb|Functor| is to give it's declaration \cite{data.functor}:

\begin{verbatim}
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|f| in the declaration is a type class constructor. Only type constructor can implement \verb|Functor| (e.g. \verb|Maybe|, \verb|[]|).

\verb|fmap| takes any function \verb|a -> b| and a value of type \verb|f a| (\verb|f| is the container or context, \verb|a| is the type wrapped inside the functor) and returns a value of type \verb|f b|. 
If \verb|f a| is of type \verb|Maybe| \verb|Int| and the function of type \verb|Int -> String|, \verb|fmap| returns \verb|Maybe String|. 

Examples of \verb|Functor| instances are:

\begin{description}
\item[List] \verb|fmap| applies the function to every element in the list.
\item[Either] \verb|Either e a| is a container. \verb|fmap| applies a function to \verb|a|.
\end{description}

To make a type an instance of \verb|Functor|, it has to define \verb|fmap|. In addition, the instances are expected to exhibit certain properties. The declaration of the type class doesn't reveal these properties. They are described in the type class documentation \cite{data.functor} \cite{Marlow_2010}. These properties are called the functor laws.
The Haskell Compiler doesn't detect violations of the expected laws. All Functor instances in the standard library obey these laws \cite{yorgey} \cite{Lipovaca}.

A \verb|Functor| instance has to satisfy the following laws.

\begin{description}
\item[Law 1] Mapping the identity function over a \verb|Functor| value, will not change the functor value. Formally
\begin{verbatim}
fmap id  ==  id
\end{verbatim}
\item[Law 2] It doesn't matter if we compose two functions and then map them over a functor or if we first map one function over the functor and then map the other function. Formally
\begin{verbatim}
fmap (g . h) = fmap g . fmap h
\end{verbatim}
This is the same as \verb|fmap (g . h) = fmap g (fmap h)|
\end{description}

If we can prove that a type satisfies these laws, we can make assumptions about how the the type will act. We know that \verb|fmap| will not change the structure or the context of the functor.
And we know that \verb|fmap| only maps the function over the functor and nothing else. 

If we know that a type satisfies the laws, we are able to deduce further properties for our own types. In section we \ref{sec:example} give an example of this process.

\subsection{Applicative Functor}
\label{sec:applicatives}

Applicative functors are abstract characterizations of an applicative style of effectful programming \cite{mcbride} \cite{control.applicative}

The \verb|Applicative| type class encapsulates the following idea. What if you have a function wrapped in a \verb|Functor| (e.g. \verb|Maybe (Int -> Int -> Int)|) and you want to apply the function to another functor (e.g. \verb|Maybe Int|). For example, we want to map \verb|Just (3 *)|, a function encapsulated inside a functor, over \verb|Just 23|, another functor with an encapsulated \verb|Int|. \verb|fmap| doesn't work here, because it expects a function of type \verb|a -> b| as first parameter. That's where the \verb|Applicative| type class comes in. 
The \verb|Applicative| type class is defined as follows \cite{control.applicative}.
\begin{verbatim}
class (Functor f) => Applicative f where
    pure :: a -> f a
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
\end{verbatim}

The type class declaration demands the type \verb|f| to be a functor. Every type that is part of \verb|Applicative| is part of \verb|Functor|. Hence we can use \verb|fmap| with \verb|Applicative| instances.
Applicatives are enhanced functors. In addition to \verb|fmap| we can use the \verb|<*>| operator to chain several \verb|Applicative| values together.

The \verb|pure| function puts a value of type \verb|a| in a default context. If applied with a function \verb|a -> b|,  \verb|pure| returns a functor with a function inside, \verb|f (a -> b)|, hence the first argument to \verb|<*>|.

It's possible to chain applicatives together as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> pure (*) <*> Just 3 <*> Just 23
Just 69
\end{verbatim}

The following types are instances of the type class \verb|Applicative|:

\begin{itemize}
\item Maybe
\item Lists
\item IO
\end{itemize}

There are several laws that \verb|Applicative| instances should satisfy \cite{mcbride} \cite{control.applicative}. This article will use only the following :

\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|pure id <*> v = v|
\item \verb|fmap g x = pure g <*> x|
\item \verb|pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)|
\end{enumerate}

The second law states that applying \verb|fmap| over a  function \verb|g| over a functor \verb|x| is the same as putting \verb|g| in a default context and mapping the resulting function over \verb|x|.

The third law states that it doesn't matter if we put the values \verb|f| and \verb|x| in a default context first and then apply \verb|<*>| or if we call \verb|f| on \verb|x| first and then put them in a default context. We will use this property to prove another property in section \ref{sec:exampleproof}

\subsection{Monoid}
\label{sec:monoiddefinition}

The \verb|Monoid| type class contains types with an associative binary operation that has an identity
Monoids are described in more detail in section \ref{sec:monoid}. Listing \ref{lst:monoiddefinition} shows the complete definition.
\begin{lstlisting}[label={lst:monoiddefinition}, caption={Definition of type class monoid}]
class Monoid m where
  mempty :: m
  mappend :: m -> m -> m
  mconcat :: [m] -> m
  mconcat = foldr mappend mempty
\end{lstlisting}
