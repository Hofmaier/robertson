One of the appeals of pure functional programming is that it is possible to use  equational reasoning. Equational reasoning allows to replace pieces of code with equivalent code. The reason is referential transparency. The technique can be used in Haskell to prove that type class laws hold.  This article explains what does it mean in programming practice by example.
